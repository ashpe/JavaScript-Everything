Step 1.

Create user account logins with admin and moderator user level.

Admin (4): Add posts, delete comments, delete posts etc.
Moderator (3): Delete comments, post comments, add posts.
Contributer (2): add posts, post comments.
Normal user (1): Add comments

Step 2.

Popup dialog box to create a new category. Simple string and check it dosn't already exist before creating.

Step 3.

Create the ability to add a blog post. Make it so it creates a blog class object, with textfields instead of the heading/content. Make user type this in, validate and have a Save button ajax request which will refresh the page and show post as a new post.
