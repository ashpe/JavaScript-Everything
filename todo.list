High Priority;

Create filter-like sidebar, swapping between categorys / or posted by certain users.
Add default posted by OR category to sqlite database. (Not both.)

Start with default category, then think about easiest way to do default user.

Step 1.

Create user account logins with admin and moderator user level.

Admin (4): Add posts, delete comments, delete posts etc.
Moderator (3): Delete comments, post comments, add posts.
Contributer (2): add posts, post comments.
Normal user (1): Add comments

// Done.

Step 2.

Popup dialog box to create a new category. Simple string and check it dosn't already exist before creating.

Step 3.

Create the ability to add a blog post. Make it so it creates a blog class object, with textfields instead of the heading/content. Make user type this in, validate and have a Save button ajax request which will refresh the page and show post as a new post.

// Done
